While Fruitful Personas is inspired by CakeResume, Enneagrams, and the 5 Love Languages, the quiz format was based on the code from CosmosPersonas! I was granted permission to modify and use it in my own project since I am a designer, not a coder, so huge thank you to I-see Warisa Jaidee for letting me use their code to create my own quiz.

Their statement is as follows:

Fun personality quiz inspired by [MBTI](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test), [Innate Personality Traits](https://typeofyou.alltheway.tw/en/), and [Cake resume](https://www.cakeresume.com/campaigns/what-cake-r-u/en?locale=en).
